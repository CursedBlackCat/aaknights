# Aaknights Calculator
This is a simple calculator for Arknights to calculate whether an operator will survive being shot by Aak's S2/S3, given its elite rank, level, and the mastery levels of Shining's S3 and Nian's S3. This calculator is hosted by GitHub pages and can be found [here](https://cursedblackcat.com/aaknights/).

Operator stats/data are pulled from [here](https://github.com/Kengxxiao/ArknightsGameData_YoStar/blob/main/en_US/gamedata/excel/character_table.json).
